import SwiftUI

/// `PulsingDotView` is a SwiftUI view that displays a horizontal row of three animated dots.
/// 
/// Each dot pulses (scales and fades in/out) in a repeating, staggered sequence, creating a
/// dynamic loading or activity indicator effect. The animation runs continuously while the view is visible.
///
/// Designed as a subtle and visually appealing indicator, this view is commonly used to show
/// progress or waiting statesâ€”such as while awaiting a response from an AI or network request.
///
/// - Usage:
///   Add `PulsingDotView()` wherever you want to show a loading animation in your SwiftUI hierarchy.
